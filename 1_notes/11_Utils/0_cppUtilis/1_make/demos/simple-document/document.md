## Introduction

Here's an excerpt from the openning crawl of Star Wars:

> It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, 
> have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. 
> During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's 
> ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power 
> to destroy an entire planet

And here's an image of the Death Star
