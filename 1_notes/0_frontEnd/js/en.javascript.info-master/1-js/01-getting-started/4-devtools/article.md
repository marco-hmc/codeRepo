# Developer console


## Google Chrome

- Here we can see the red-colored error message. In this case, the script contains an unknown "lalala" command.
- On the right, there is a clickable link to the source `bug.html:12` with the line number where the error has occurred.
- 
Now we can see errors, and that's enough for a start. We'll come back to developer tools later and cover debugging more in-depth in the chapter <info:debugging-chrome>.

```smart header="Multi-line input"
Usually, when we put a line of code into the console, and then press `key:Enter`, it executes.

To insert multiple lines, press `key:Shift+Enter`. This way one can enter long fragments of JavaScript code.
```

## Firefox, Edge, and others

Most other browsers use `key:F12` to open developer tools.

The look & feel of them is quite similar. Once you know how to use one of these tools (you can start with Chrome), you can easily switch to another.

## Safari

Safari (Mac browser, not supported by Windows/Linux) is a little bit special here. We need to enable the "Develop menu" first.

Open Preferences and go to the "Advanced" pane. There's a checkbox at the bottom:

Now `key:Cmd+Opt+C` can toggle the console. Also, note that the new top menu item named "Develop" has appeared. It has many commands and options.

## Summary

- Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables, and much more.
- They can be opened with `key:F12` for most browsers on Windows. Chrome for Mac needs `key:Cmd+Opt+J`, Safari: `key:Cmd+Opt+C` (need to enable first).

Now we have the environment ready. In the next section, we'll get down to JavaScript.
