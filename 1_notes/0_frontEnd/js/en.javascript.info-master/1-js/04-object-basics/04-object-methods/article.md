# Object methods, "this"

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

And, in the real world, a user can *act*: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.

## Method examples

For a start, let's teach the `user` to say hello:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

user.sayHi = function() {
  alert("Hello!");
};

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

```js run
let user = {
  // ...
};

// first, declare
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hello!");
}

// then add as a method
user.sayHi = sayHi;
user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them?

### Method shorthand

There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:

```js
// these objects do the same
user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
*!*
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
*/!*
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

## "this" in methods

**To access the object, a method can use the `this` keyword.**

The value of `this` is the object "before dot", the one used to call the method.

For instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    alert(this.name);
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // John
```

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    alert(user.name); // "user" instead of "this"
  }

};
```

...But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy `user` to another variable, e.g. `admin = user` and overwrite `user` with something else, then it will access the wrong object.

That's demonstrated below:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    alert( user.name ); // leads to an error
  }

};

let admin = user;
user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious

admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
```

If we used `this.name` instead of `user.name` inside the `alert`, then the code would work.

## "this" is not bound

```js
function sayHi() {
  alert( *!*this*/!*.name );
}
```

For instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different "this" in the calls:

```js run
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method â€“ doesn't matter)
```

```js run
function sayHi() {
  alert(this);
}

sayHi(); // undefined
```

In JavaScript `this` is "free", its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is "before the dot".

The concept of run-time evaluated `this` has both pluses and minuses. 
On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.

Here our position is not to judge whether this language design decision is good or bad. 

## Arrow functions have no "this"

Arrow functions are special: they don't have their "own" `this`. If we reference `this` from such a function, it's taken from the outer "normal" function.

For instance, here `arrow()` uses `this` from the outer `user.sayHi()` method:

```js run
let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```

## Summary

- Functions that are stored in object properties are called "methods".
- Methods allow objects to "act" like `object.doSomething()`.
- Methods can reference the object as `this`.

The value of `this` is defined at run-time.
- When a function is declared, it may use `this`, but that `this` has no value until the function is called.
- A function can be copied between objects.
- When a function is called in the "method" syntax: `object.method()`, the value of `this` during the call is `object`.

Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no `this`. When `this` is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
