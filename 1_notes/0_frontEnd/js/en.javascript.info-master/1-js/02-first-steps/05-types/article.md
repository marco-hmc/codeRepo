# Data types

## Number

```js
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;
```

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called "special numeric values" which also belong to this data type: `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `NaN`.

- `Infinity` represents the mathematical [Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) ∞. It is a special value that's greater than any number.

- `NaN` represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance:

## Objects and Symbols

The `object` type is special.

All other types are called "primitive" because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We'll deal with them later in the chapter <info:object>, after we learn more about primitives.

The `symbol` type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.

## The typeof operator [#type-typeof]

The `typeof` operator returns the type of the operand. It's useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

A call to `typeof x` returns a string with the type name:

```js
typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof 10n // "bigint"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

*!*
typeof Math // "object"  (1)
*/!*

*!*
typeof null // "object"  (2)
*/!*

*!*
typeof alert // "function"  (3)
*/!*
```

The last three lines may need additional explanation:

1. `Math` is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations. We will learn it in the chapter <info:number>. Here, it serves just as an example of an object.
2. The result of `typeof null` is `"object"`. That's an officially recognized error in `typeof`, coming from very early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, `null` is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own. The behavior of `typeof` is wrong here.
3. The result of `typeof alert` is `"function"`, because `alert` is a function. We'll study functions in the next chapters where we'll also see that there's no special "function" type in JavaScript. Functions belong to the object type. But `typeof` treats them differently, returning `"function"`. That also comes from the early days of JavaScript. Technically, such behavior isn't correct, but can be convenient in practice.

```smart header="The `typeof(x)` syntax"
You may also come across another syntax: `typeof(x)`. It's the same as `typeof x`.

To put it clear: `typeof` is an operator, not a function. The parentheses here aren't a part of `typeof`. It's the kind of parentheses used for mathematical grouping.

Usually, such parentheses contain a mathematical expression, such as `(2 + 2)`, but here they contain only one argument `(x)`. Syntactically, they allow to avoid a space between the `typeof` operator and its argument, and some people like it.

Some people prefer `typeof(x)`, although the `typeof x` syntax is much more common.
```

## Summary

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

- Seven primitive data types:
    - `number` for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by <code>±(2<sup>53</sup>-1)</code>.
    - `bigint` for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
    - `string` for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there's no separate single-character type.
    - `boolean` for `true`/`false`.
    - `null` for unknown values -- a standalone type that has a single value `null`.
    - `undefined` for unassigned values -- a standalone type that has a single value `undefined`.
    - `symbol` for unique identifiers.
- And one non-primitive data type:
    - `object` for more complex data structures.

The `typeof` operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

- Usually used as `typeof x`, but `typeof(x)` is also possible.
- Returns a string with the name of the type, like `"string"`.
- For `null` returns `"object"` -- this is an error in the language, it's not actually an object.

In the next chapters, we'll concentrate on primitive values and once we're familiar with them, we'll move on to objects.
