- **MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference** is the main manual with examples and other information. It's great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.

    You can find it at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference>.

Although, it's often best to use an internet search instead. Just use "MDN [term]" in the query, e.g. <https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt> to search for the `parseInt` function.
