## Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.

These operators are not JavaScript-specific. They are supported in most programming languages.

The list of operators:

- AND ( `&` )
- OR ( `|` )
- XOR ( `^` )
- NOT ( `~` )
- LEFT SHIFT ( `<<` )
- RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>` )
- ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>>` )

These operators are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise) level. We won't need these operators any time soon, as web development has little use of them, but in some special areas, such as cryptography, they are useful. You can read the [Bitwise Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bitwise_operators) chapter on MDN when a need arises.

## Comma

The comma operator `,` is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. Sometimes, it's used to write shorter code, so we need to know it in order to understand what's going on.

The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma `,`. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.
