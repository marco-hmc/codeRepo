**Open science** is the movement to make scientific research, data and
dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur
or professional. It encompasses practices such as publishing `open
research <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research>`__, campaigning
for `open access <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access>`__,
encouraging scientists to practice `open notebook
science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science>`__, and
generally making it easier to publish and communicate scientific
knowledge.
