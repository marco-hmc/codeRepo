# Type Conversions


## String Conversion


## Numeric Conversion

## Boolean Conversion

Boolean conversion is the simplest one.

It happens in logical operations (later we'll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be performed explicitly with a call to `Boolean(value)`.

The conversion rule:

- Values that are intuitively "empty", like `0`, an empty string, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`, become `false`.
- Other values become `true`.

For instance:

```js run
alert( Boolean(1) ); // true
alert( Boolean(0) ); // false

alert( Boolean("hello") ); // true
alert( Boolean("") ); // false
```

````warn header="Please note: the string with zero `\"0\"` is `true`"
Some languages (namely PHP) treat `"0"` as `false`. But in JavaScript, a non-empty string is always `true`.

```js run
alert( Boolean("0") ); // true
alert( Boolean(" ") ); // spaces, also true (any non-empty string is true)
```

## Summary

The three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.

**`String Conversion`** -- Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with `String(value)`. The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.

**`Numeric Conversion`** -- Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with `Number(value)`.

The conversion follows the rules:

| Value |  Becomes... |
|-------|-------------|
|`undefined`|`NaN`|
|`null`|`0`|
|<code>true&nbsp;/&nbsp;false</code> | `1 / 0` |
| `string` | The string is read "as is", whitespaces (includes spaces, tabs `\t`, newlines `\n` etc.) from both sides are ignored. An empty string becomes `0`. An error gives `NaN`. |

**`Boolean Conversion`** -- Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with `Boolean(value)`.

Follows the rules:

| Value |  Becomes... |
|-------|-------------|
|`0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `""` |`false`|
|any other value| `true` |


Most of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:

- `undefined` is `NaN` as a number, not `0`.
- `"0"` and space-only strings like `"   "` are true as a boolean.

Objects aren't covered here. We'll return to them later in the chapter <info:object-toprimitive> that is devoted exclusively to objects after we learn more basic things about JavaScript.
