<h1 id="the-r-project-for-statistical-computing">The R Project for Statistical Computing</h1>
<p>R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To <strong><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">download R</a></strong>, please choose your preferred <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">CRAN mirror</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions about R like how to download and install the software, or what the license terms are, please read our answers to frequently asked questions before you send an email.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-r">What is R?</h2>
<p>R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a> which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.</p>
<p>R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.</p>
<h2 id="the-r-environment">The R environment</h2>
<p>R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an effective data handling and storage facility,</li>
<li>a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,</li>
<li>a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and</li>
<li>a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term &quot;environment&quot; is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.</p>
