## What is R?

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
It is a [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/) which is similar to the S language 
and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now 
Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. 

R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some 
important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
