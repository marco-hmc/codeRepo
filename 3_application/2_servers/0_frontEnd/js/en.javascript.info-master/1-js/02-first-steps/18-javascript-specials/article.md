## Operators
## Functions

1. Function Declaration: the function in the main code flow

2. Function Expression: the function in the context of an expression

3. Arrow functions:


- Functions may have local variables: those declared inside its body or its parameter list. Such variables are only visible inside the function.
- Parameters can have default values: `function sum(a = 1, b = 2) {...}`.
- Functions always return something. If there's no `return` statement, then the result is `undefined`.
